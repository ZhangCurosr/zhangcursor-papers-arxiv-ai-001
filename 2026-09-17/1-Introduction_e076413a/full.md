Computer-use agents increasingly operate software designed for people, but interfaces often leave actions or task state unclear to machine readers. We present Afora, a design system that supports both readers while preserving visual freedom and familiar human workflows. Three controlled studies examine component implementations, visual variation, and interaction-design principles. Their findings inform guidance from individual components to complete sites, supported by reusable implementations and executable checks. Agent performance depends on the interaction meaning available through its interface representation; substantial visual variation remains possible when that meaning is preserved. Evaluation on independently authored interfaces shows gains where Afora addresses existing deficits, but limited efects where those deficits are absent or outside its coverage. A workflow case provides preliminary evidence of reduced interaction cost. Afora connects user experience and agent experience through a shared interface rather than a separate agent-only surface.

## 1. Introduction

Computer-use agents increasingly operate software interfaces used for everyday tasks. Their performance depends not only on model capability but also on how an interface represents its available actions and current state. A control may appear obvious to a person yet be absent or ambiguous in the representation an agent receives. Improving agent reliability therefore raises a design question: how should the interface itself support an agent reader while remaining familiar to people?

We present Afora, a design system for a shared human–agent interface. Its name draws on J. J. Gibson’s concept of afordance, understood as possibilities for action in relation to an actor’s capabilities (Gibson 1977). Afora specifies how interaction meaning should remain recoverable from the interface while allowing visual expression to vary. In the web implementation studied here, this structure is carried by the rendered DOM and exposed through the agent’s observation channel. The system is intended to fit existing design and development workflows while retaining familiar interfaces for human users.

We investigate this approach through three studies of component implementations, visual variation, and established interaction-design principles. Their findings inform design guidance across component, layout, flow, and site scales, implemented through reusable components and executable checks. We then evaluate transfer to independently authored interfaces and examine interaction cost in a complete workflow. The contribution is a design system together with evidence about where its rules help, where they have little efect, and where their coverage remains incomplete. Afora connects user experience (UX) and agent experience (AX) within one interface; its benefits for human users remain a subject for future evaluation.

## 2. Related work

Design systems, accessibility, and semantic interfaces. Design systems distribute tokens, components, and interaction patterns to preserve consistency and accessibility across products (Putnam, Rose, and MacDonald 2023; Lamine and Cheng 2022). Accessibility standards such as WCAG and ARIA likewise specify how controls, names, relationships, and states should be exposed beyond their visual presentation. These traditions establish that an interface has structure beneath its styling, but they optimize primarily for human use, including use through assistive technologies. Afora builds on that semantic foundation while asking a diferent question: whether the rendered interface exposes enough persistent, enumerable, and operable structure for an autonomous reader to complete a task. Agents and disabled users are not equated; rather, both make the consequences of an underspecified semantic layer visible (Reid 2024)

Computer-use agents and interface grounding. Research on computer-use agents has largely asked how an agent can understand and act on interfaces as they are given. Mind2Web, WebArena, VisualWebArena, SeeAct, WebVoyager, BrowserGym, and related systems study grounding through DOM representations, accessibility trees, screenshots, or combinations of these representations (Deng et al. 2023; Zhou et al. 2024; Koh et al. 2024; Zheng et al. 2024; He et al. 2024; Le Sellier De Chezelles et al. 2024). Set-of-Mark prompting similarly alters the agent’s visual observation to make targets easier to reference (Yang et al. 2023). Afora reverses the direction of intervention: rather than adapting the reader to an existing interface, it asks which properties of the interface itself should be invariant so that multiple kinds of reader can operate it reliably.

Agent-facing representations and action layers. Agent-facing documentation and structured tools provide additional ways for agents to understand or operate software. Files such as llms.txt and project instruction files provide information outside the rendered interface (Howard 2024), while WebMCP exposes callable operations from web applications (Walderman et al. 2026). These mechanisms difer in what they make available to the agent and need not replace the graphical interface. Afora focuses on the structure exposed by the interface itself. Section 6.2 compares concrete implementations on targeted interface failures; Table 1 describes those interventions rather than guarantees of the underlying standards.

Agent experience and agent-compatible interface design. Recent work has begun to treat computer-use agents as a distinct class of interface reader. Goldenberg and Goldenberg discuss agent experience by reconsidering Nielsen’s usability heuristics for GenAI agents (Goldenberg and Goldenberg 2025). Rongon et al. propose a framework for agent-readable interfaces that emphasizes observable state and explicit interaction meaning (Rongon, Hasan, and Prangon 2026). Liu et al. experimentally evaluate augmentations of Nielsen’s heuristics, finding improved agent task completion and no observable usability regressions in their human evaluation (Liu et al. 2026). Together, these works establish interface design itself as a variable in reliable computer use.

Afora extends this direction by expressing agent compatibility through reusable implementations and checks within a design system. It tests principles drawn from multiple interaction-design traditions under readers with diferent perceptual, memory, and action costs, and applies the resulting guidance across component, layout, flow, and site scales. Section 4.3 examines these diferences experimentally.

## 3. Research Questions and Interface Model

Afora is motivated by a simple question: what properties must an interface expose for a computer-use agent to operate it reliably, without constraining how it looks to people? We address this through three research questions:

RQ1: Where does agent-facing interface failure arise? When computer-use agents fail on ordinary interface components, to what extent is the failure explained by the interface’s semantic substrate rather than by model capability or visual presentation?

RQ2: Which visual design decisions can vary without reducing agent performance? If the semantic substrate is held fixed, how freely can designers vary styling and layout while preserving reliable agent interaction?

RQ3: How do established interaction-design principles change when the reader is an agent? Which principles developed for human users still hold, which become more important, and which weaken or reverse when the reader has diferent perceptual, memory, and action costs?

The three studies in Section 4 address these questions in order. Study 1 compares component implementations to localize the deficit; Study 2 holds the substrate fixed while varying visual design; and Study 3 experimentally re-examines established interaction-design principles for computer-use agents.

A shared interface, two readers. A software interface presents more than what it visually renders. We distinguish between what an interface paints and what it declares. The painted layer contains its visual expression—colour, typography, shape, spacing, composition, motion, and other styling decisions. The declared layer contains the controls, names, relationships, state, choices, and task-relevant information represented in a form that can be recovered from the interface itself. We call this declared layer the semantic substrate, or simply the substrate below.

People and computer-use agents can operate the same interface while reading these layers diferently. A person primarily perceives the rendered interface and interprets its text, spatial organization, visual hierarchy, and learned conventions. An agent instead acts through a projection of the interface, such as a serialised list of interactive elements with roles and names (Zheng et al. 2024; Lù, Kasner, and Reddy 2024), an accessibility tree (Zhou et al. 2024; Le Sellier De Chezelles et al. 2024), a marked screenshot, or raw pixels. These projections expose diferent portions of the interface and diferent action spaces. DOM, accessibility-tree, and marked-screen representations explicitly enumerate candidate actions, whereas raw-pixel interaction requires the agent to infer actionable regions visually

The substrate matters at multiple scales. At component scale, it determines whether an apparent control is represented as an operable control, whether it has a stable name, whether its current state can be recovered, and whether its available choices are exposed. At layout scale, it preserves recoverable relationships among components as their composition changes. At flow scale, it determines whether the interface carries the state and progress needed to continue a task. At site scale, it includes stable mappings between functions, names, and representations across pages. Our use of substrate is narrower than the term’s use in interaction theory for the computational medium in which information resides (Beaudouin-Lafon, Bødker, and Mackay 2021): here it denotes the machine-readable structure carried by the rendered interface itself.

Figure 1 makes this distinction concrete. The same rendered interface may provide rich visual cues to a person while exposing only part of its actionable structure to a machine reader. Conversely, an agent-facing channel such as agent.md or WebMCP may provide information or actions that do not belong to the shared rendered interface at all. Afora focuses on the shared surface: the structure that remains part of the interface both readers use.

Figure 2 illustrates three representative substrate changes: making an apparent control directly operable, keeping choices available to the machine-readable representation, and retaining an outcome as persistent state. These interventions can alter what an agent can perceive and act upon without requiring a corresponding change in the interface’s visual identity.

The substrate is therefore not an agent-only representation. It remains part of the same interface rendered for a person, which creates substantial overlap with accessibility practice: both depend on controls, names, relationships, and state being represented beyond visual styling. Afora builds on that foundation but focuses specifically on whether the shared interface exposes the information a computer-use agent needs to identify available actions, recover task state, and continue interaction through the representations it receives.

In Norman’s terms (Norman 2008, 2013), visual appearance can provide a strong signifier to a person while providing little or no corresponding signifier in the representation available to an agent. Afora therefore treats

agent-facing interface design as a problem of making action possibilities explicit across machine-readable representations while leaving the visual expression of the interface free to vary.

## 4. What Makes an Interface Agent-Friendly

We examine agent-friendliness as a property of the interface, rather than of agent capability alone. Three studies progressively isolate where it comes from, what can vary without disrupting it, and how it changes established interaction-design assumptions.

4.1 Study 1: Where interface failures arise. Design. We compare implementations of sixty interactive components using native HTML and eight commonly used component libraries, holding task content and goals constant. The libraries represent modern UI abstractions rather than systems designed for agents. We examine how each implementation exposes actionable structure after rendering; Figure 3 shows nine representative component kinds.

Main result. Agent performance varies systematically across implementations. Plain semantic HTML reaches 91%, while the eight component libraries range from 86.7% to 68.3% on the mid-tier model (Fig. 3). Failures cluster around recurring representational diferences: choices that appear only after interaction, controls whose role or state is dificult to recover, and interaction outcomes that are weakly represented in the rendered structure. In a controlled repair sequence, correcting semantics raises success from 43% to 67%, and additionally exposing agent-relevant choices and state raises it to 90%.

Meaning. The result is not that modern component libraries are poorly designed, but that abstractions optimized for human-facing interfaces do not necessarily preserve the same information for a machine reader after rendering. Two implementations can present equivalent tasks to a person while exposing diferent

The same interaction tasks are implemented using native HTML and eight component libraries, revealing systematic diferences in agent task completion despite equivalent task content. The matrix shows nine representative component kinds; aggregate results cover the full component set.

DOM structure, state, or action possibilities to an agent. Semantic correctness therefore matters, but is not suficient: reliable agent interaction also depends on whether relevant controls, choices, and outcomes remain explicit and recoverable in the interface substrate.

4.2 Study 2: What visual design matters to agents. Design. We study visual design at two levels while holding task content and semantic substrate constant. First, five components are rendered across sixteen themes and six layout archetypes. Second, we vary individual visual properties on a signed scale from treatments that contradict familiar conventions, through neutral treatments, to treatments that reinforce them (Fig. 4). For this exploratory visual-cue analysis, we report complete five-condition blocks for the available Luna marked-pixel run; each block shares a component, property family, and repetition.

Main result. Across the tested themes, DOM-channel completion remains at 99.5%, matching the native presentation; pixel performance is 92%, compared with 94% for native controls. All episodes succeed in the tested extreme-theme and layout combinations in both channels. The exploratory visual-cue sweep is also close to ceiling: completion ranges from 98.7% to 99.8% across the five signed strengths, without a monotonic improvement as cues become more reinforcing. These results do not establish a general benefit from stronger visual cues.

Meaning. Within the tested components and tasks, substantial changes in visual identity preserve agent performance when the semantic substrate remains intact. The visual-cue sweep does not justify ranking aesthetics by agent-friendliness. Its marked-pixel reader also receives enumerated targets, so the result should not be generalized to agents that locate actions from raw pixels alone. Visual freedom is therefore supported within the tested observation models, rather than established for every kind of agent reader.

4.3 Study 3: How canonical interaction-design principles change for computer-use agents. Design. We translate seven established interaction-design principles into controlled interface comparisons, drawing on Miller (1956), Nielsen (1994), Norman (2013), and Shneiderman et al. (2016), holding task information constant while varying the design decision implied by each principle. We measure task completion or interaction cost across three models and two observation channels, targeting ten repetitions per replication condition. Figure 5 illustrates conditions from the Luna runs, including the earlier vocabulary pilot. We interpret each principle in relation to the agent’s observation, memory, and action model.

Main result. The interaction-design canon does not transfer uniformly to computer-use agents. Explicit remedies improve recovery, while added confirmation increases interaction cost in the tested tasks. Recognition and visual signifiers depend on what the observation channel exposes. Splitting a form into steps adds interaction cost without a demonstrated completion benefit, and explaining disabled states shows no consistent gain across replications. These findings concern observed task behavior, not a direct measurement of cognitive load or the safety value of confirmation.

Meaning. The change of reader changes the mechanism behind familiar design advice. Human-facing principles often assume persistent memory, learned conventions, perceptual continuity, and meaningful motor cost. Computer-use agents may instead re-observe the interface at each step, lose task state across context boundaries, or receive candidate actions already enumerated by their observation channel. Consistency therefore matters when it preserves a mapping the agent must reuse, but less when every screen is interpreted

afresh. Recognition matters when the required information is present in the current observation, not merely because it appeared earlier. Confirmation can add unnecessary interaction cost, while explicit recovery becomes more valuable when the agent cannot infer a remedy from context. The implication is not to discard the existing canon, but to restate its principles in terms of the perceptual, memory, and action model of the reader.

## 5. An agent-friendly design system

From the studies, we derive a design methodology for agent-friendly interfaces: make action-relevant structure explicit and machine-readable, preserve visual expression as an independent design layer, and carry task state and interaction meaning beyond individual components. Afora operationalizes this methodology as a design system spanning component, layout, flow, and site scales. Across these scales, Afora follows a common set of design rules:

∙ Make task-relevant structure explicit and persistent. Controls, choices, state, and outcomes should remain available to the reader rather than existing only transiently or in interaction history.

∙ Align machine-readable and visible structure. What the interface exposes in the DOM or other machine-readable representations should correspond to what is visibly presented and operated.

∙ Prefer presence over hidden disclosure. Information needed for planning should remain discoverable without first requiring hover, expansion, animation, or other transient interaction.

∙ Preserve semantic continuity. Recurring functions, task state, and interaction meaning should remain identifiable as the reader moves across components, steps, and pages.

∙ Keep visual expression flexible. Colour, typography, shape, composition, and other stylistic decisions may vary as long as they do not remove or contradict the interaction meaning above.

Figure 6 summarizes how these rules are applied throughout the system.

5.1 Design scales. Component scale. Afora follows substrate invariant, skin variable: controls, names, state, choices, and outcomes remain explicit and operable, while colour, typography, shape, motion, and other stylistic properties may vary. Principles P1–P10 formalize these requirements.

Layout scale. Layout concerns how components are composed while preserving recoverable relationships and access to task-relevant content. It applies existing requirements, particularly P5 on semantic hierarchy and P9 on structural correspondence, across a page rather than introducing a separate family of principles. Layout transformations are assessed through page-level preservation checks and the theme–layout comparisons in Study 2. The evidence status of P5 and P9 remains observational; the layout experiment does not validate every possible composition.

Flow scale. The interface must carry the state a reader needs to continue a task, including progress, prior choices, requirements, recovery paths, and completion. Designers remain free to vary pacing, screen count, and presentation order. Principles F1–F7 and reusable flow patterns encode these requirements.

Site scale. Afora preserves mappings that a reader may need to reuse across pages, such as stable names and representations for recurring functions. It does not require visual uniformity across the product; the constraint is semantic continuity. Principles SC1–SC3 define this scope.

5.2 System artifacts. Afora is delivered as both a set of plug-and-play UI building blocks and a set of software design guidelines for agent-friendly interfaces. Teams can adopt the reference components directly or reproduce the same rules in their existing stack. The components separate semantic structure from visual expression, allowing Afora to adapt to diferent visual themes as long as the underlying design constraints are preserved.

Reusable UI components. Afora provides reference implementations for common interface elements, including forms, selection controls, dialogs, tables, and product-oriented components. Each embeds the required semantic substrate by default, so teams do not need to reconstruct agent-facing behavior for every interface.

Design guidance and theming. The library is paired with component-, layout-, flow-, and site-level design rules. Style and layout tokens allow colour, typography, shape, density, and composition to vary while keeping task-relevant controls, state, and relationships intact. Afora therefore defines constraints on interaction meaning rather than prescribing a single visual language.

AI-assisted implementation. Because the design rules are explicit and the reference components are distributed as source, they can be used directly in AI-assisted coding workflows. A coding agent can reuse established components and patterns rather than repeatedly inferring the intended semantics of custom interface code. By making controls, state, choices, and outcomes explicit by construction, Afora also removes a class of interface-induced ambiguities that would otherwise surface later as agent failures and debugging work.

Figure 6 relates the design scales to the system’s supporting mechanisms.

5.3 From guidelines to executable constraints. Afora turns part of its design guidance into constraints that software can inspect directly. Component-level checks test whether controls are operable and named, state is recoverable, choices remain enumerable, and machine-readable targets align with the visible interface. Page-level checks additionally verify that transformations preserve information, interaction opportunities, and behavior.

These constraints can also be exposed in machine-readable form to AI-assisted development workflows. Coding agents can consume Afora’s rules alongside the component library—for example through project instructions or skill.md-style guidance—and apply them while generating, modifying, or debugging interfaces. This creates a path from post-hoc compliance checking toward enforcing agent-friendly structure during implementation itself.

Passing the checks is a conformance floor rather than a guarantee of task success: it establishes that required interface properties are present, while model capability, visual grounding, flow state, and application behavior may still afect performance. The full mapping from principles to checks and evidence status is given in the appendix, Principle index.

## 6. Evaluation

We evaluate whether shared-interface interventions address the same targeted failures as alternative agent facing mechanisms, whether the rules transfer to independently authored interfaces, and how rule coverage difers from conformance. A separate workflow case examines interaction cost.

Execution harness and reproducibility. All reported episodes run through our authored agent-evaluation harness. It provides a common execution loop for computer use and structured tool use, ReAct-style observe–reason–act cycles, bounded retry after failed actions, and task-scoped memory across steps. We instantiate this harness with the OpenAI ChatGPT 5.6 Luna and ChatGPT 5.6 Terra variants, both at the low reasoning tier, referred to throughout as Luna and Terra. For every episode, the harness records the model and observation configuration, action and retry trace, terminal application state, and evaluator verdict. Experiments ran locally on macOS 26.2 on a MacBook Pro with an Apple M4 Pro and 48 GB unified memory, using Node.js v25.2.1, Python 3.14.7, and Docker 29.7.2. We deployed WebArena’s Magento storefront and WebShop in local Docker containers, with environment snapshots and task configurations fixed within each comparison.

A task or goal is a unique specification; an episode is one agent attempt under a model and observation con dition. Tables report successful episodes over recorded attempts. Results are not pooled across environments, and difering denominators are retained rather than treated as matched pairs.

6.1 Evaluation setup and cases. Five authored domains support comparison of Afora with ARIA and structured-data augmentation, an agent.md read layer, and a WebMCP-style action layer. WebArena’s Magento storefront, WebShop, and four independently authored applications test transfer beyond interfaces built for Afora. The release workflow is an author-built adaptation of a community template and is evaluated separately.

Magento provides a controlled transport test: we introduce a component-level deficit into an otherwise functional application and ask whether the published rule restores the lost behavior. WebShop and the four applications contribute deficits already present in their interfaces. Before agent runs, application tasks are classified by whether the target is visible, predictably disclosed by its label, or hidden behind a label that does not predict its contents.

Within each comparison, both arms use the same recorded-state success criterion. Page-level gates assess whether a rewrite preserves the original information, available interactions, and external efects. These gates establish transformation validity, not a guarantee of agent success.

6.2 Comparison with alternative interventions. On the primary comparison set, Afora and the instruction-file condition both reach full completion, an improvement of approximately 23 percentage points over baseline (Table 2). Afora also reaches full completion on the harder set, while the instruction-file condition has one failure. ARIA and structured-data augmentation produces no consistent improvement in these conditions.

The WebMCP-style condition reaches full completion on its applicable action set. Its diferent denominator means that this result is not a matched comparison with the other interventions. The findings support the value of making required information or actions available through a representation the agent consumes, without establishing that one mechanism is universally superior.

Green marks a favourable change; red an unfavourable change. Black denotes no change or no matched comparison. Colours do not indicate statistical significance.

6.3 Transfer and rule coverage. Across independent interfaces, improvement tracks the presence of the deficit a rule addresses. On Magento, introducing a targeted deficit lowers completion by approximately eight percentage points. Applying the corresponding rewrite restores completion to approximately the original level (Table 3). Rewriting already-sound components produces no improvement.

WebShop distinguishes rule coverage from faithful implementation. The published rules leave its native hidden-radio failure unchanged. Extending the rule set to cover that idiom raises full-reward completion by approximately 61 percentage points. This extension is a diagnostic response to a newly encountered pattern, not evidence that the original rule set already generalized to it.

In the administrative applications, the largest gains occur for targets behind labels that do not predict their contents. Results for predictably labelled groups are mixed, while already-visible targets show little change. MUI and Atomic CRM are near-null at component level. Table 4 reports the application and task-class breakdown, including negative changes. Denominators are recorded attempts and can difer between arms; unmatched attempts are not treated as paired evidence.

6.4 Conformance and workflow eficiency. Conformance. Preservation gates and rule checks answer diferent questions. The former test whether the task remains equivalent after a rewrite; the latter inspect whether the interface satisfies specified design requirements. Neither establishes that the requirements cover every interaction pattern or that an agent will complete the task. WebShop illustrates the coverage limit, while near-null component rewrites show why passing component checks cannot establish the quality of an entire workflow. We do not report a separate quantitative validation of the check suite here.

Workflow design. We compare baseline and Afora versions of an author-built release workflow using two models and two observation channels. Correct publication and completion of the final verification are assessed separately. Costs are compared only for paired episodes in which both versions complete the task.

Main result. Afora reduces action counts by approximately 21–40% and total token use by 24–41% across the four model–channel conditions (Table 5). Reasoning-token changes are mixed. Completion improves in the Luna vision condition and remains unchanged in the others. With only one or two successful pairs per condition, the results provide preliminary evidence of lower interaction cost in this workflow, not a general estimate of eficiency gains.

Parentheses show percentage change relative to baseline, rounded to whole percentages; 1/2 to $2 / 2 \mathrm { ~ i s ~ } + 1 0 0 \%$ relative (+50 percentage points). Costs are totals over successful pairs; total tokens include reasoning tokens. Green marks higher completion or lower cost, red the reverse, and black no change.

Visualising the full-workflow case. Figure 8 shows how the interface changes appear along a fixed baseline– Afora trajectory. Both episodes reach correct publication, but only the Afora episode completes final verification. The figure illustrates the recorded interaction sequence; Table 5 provides the aggregate results.

## 7. Discussion and conclusion

Afora suggests a broader design position: as agents become software operators, interfaces increasingly serve both human and machine readers. Agent-friendly design should therefore improve machine operation without making software less legible, observable, or controllable for people.

7.1 Shared and observable agent experience. Afora treats agent experience as a property of the software environment, not only of the agent. Explicit controls, persistent state, recoverable outcomes, and visible progress help agents operate an interface, but they can also make autonomous activity easier for people to inspect.

This matters because machine actions may occur faster than people can follow them step by step. Human supervision therefore cannot depend only on reading an execution trace. A shared interface can instead expose the consequential state of the work: what changed, what remains incomplete, what failed, and what can be reversed. We treat this supervisability benefit as a design implication rather than a measured claim, since the present work does not include a human study.

7.2 Eficiency as an interface property. Afora also suggests that agent eficiency is partly an interface property. When state, available actions, progress, and recovery information are explicit, an agent can spend fewer interaction cycles rediscovering context, probing hidden controls, or repeating actions whose efects are unclear. In the end-to-end workflow evaluation, Afora reduces both action count and total token use across all four model–channel conditions, although reasoning-token use is mixed.

This shifts part of the eficiency problem from model optimization to interface design. A more legible interface can reduce unnecessary observations, actions, and context consumption even when the underlying agent is unchanged. In deployed systems, this may translate into lower inference cost and latency, although wall-clock savings were not directly measured in our experiments.

7.3 Shared interfaces versus tool and command interfaces. Afora is complementary to structured agent interfaces such as WebMCP, APIs, and command-line tools. These mechanisms can provide more direct and eficient machine action by avoiding visual grounding and GUI operation. Afora addresses a diferent question: whether task state and interaction meaning remain represented on a surface that both people and agents can inspect.

The two approaches can coexist. Agents may act through structured tools while consequential state is projected back into a shared interface. The same distinction applies to command-line interaction: commands and textual outputs are highly machine-friendly, but a persistent interface can better expose relationships, progress, outstanding work, and recovery options over time.

This suggests a broader principle: machine-eficient action need not require a machine-only representation of state.

7.4 Beyond the DOM: desktop interfaces and software for human–agent collaboration. The semantic substrate studied here is implemented through web representations, but the distinction between visible and machine readable interface structure is not web-specific. Windows UI Automation exposes control properties and supported actions (Microsoft 2025). macOS accessibility APIs and Linux AT-SPI likewise expose structured interface information (Apple 2015) (The AT-SPI2 Maintainers n.d.). Electron can expose Chromium’s accessibility tree through platform accessibility support (Electron Contributors n.d.). These mechanisms suggest possible implementations of Afora’s semantic substrate beyond the DOM; transfer to them has not been evaluated here.

The same principles can therefore be asked of desktop software: whether visible controls correspond to machine-operable elements, whether state and available actions are recoverable, and whether task state survives transitions between views or windows. Testing Afora across native and Electron applications would determine how far these rules generalize beyond the web.

Software for human–agent collaboration extends this design problem to one or more people and agents working together through shared interfaces and persistent task state. Explicit state alone may be insuficient when participants act on shared work: the interface may also need to show who made a change, who is responsible for the next step, and whether actions conflict or can be reversed. Supporting this coordination is a possible extension of Afora’s state and continuity rules, but has not been implemented or evaluated here.

7.5 Limitations. The present evidence is bounded in several ways. We evaluate small- and mid-tier models rather than frontier systems, and the strongest visual-design results come from components and relatively short tasks. The independent applications are concentrated in administrative and commerce interfaces, so broader ecological validity remains untested.

The work also evaluates machine readers rather than human users. Accessibility conformance and preservation of familiar interface structure do not establish usability, trust, or supervisability for people. The executable checks likewise cover only properties that can be decided from the rendered artifact; they are a conformance floor rather than a predictor of task success.

Finally, the extensions to desktop interfaces and software for human–agent collaboration discussed above remain hypotheses. The current implementation and evaluation are primarily web-based.

7.6 Conclusion. Afora shows that designing for computer-use agents does not require collapsing software into a machine-oriented interface. Agent-relevant controls, choices, state, and outcomes can be made explicit while visual expression remains flexible.

More broadly, the work points toward software whose state remains legible regardless of who operates it. Agents may act through graphical interfaces, structured tools, command lines, or APIs; what can remain shared is the interface’s representation of what is possible, what has happened, and what state the system is now in. Afora ofers one design-system approach toward that shared human–agent surface.
