## Abstract

The rapid deployment of autonomous AI agents across consequential domains including healthcare, legal services, financial management, and enterprise workflows has created an urgent governance challenge. While the field of AI evaluation has produced sophisticated benchmarks for measuring agent capability, these frameworks measure exclusively what agents can do rather than how they do it. The ethical dimensions most critical to responsible agent deployment, including respect for human autonomy, harm avoidance, transparency and non-deception, privacy compliance, and accountability, are systematically absent from current evaluation practice.

This paper addresses that gap through three contributions. First, a structured literature review of twelve leading AI agent benchmarks characterizes the ethical dimensions those bench marks do and do not measure. Second, the Ethical Evaluation Framework for AI Agents (EEFA) is introduced as a comprehensive, operationalizable instrument for ethical agent evaluation, grounded in established AI ethics principles and designed for use by developers, auditors, and regulators. Third, a reproducible validation protocol is specified for applying the EEFA to deployed agent systems, with illustrative test scenarios across all five framework dimensions.

The EEFA is organized across five primary dimensions: Autonomy Preservation, Harm Avoidance, Transparency and Non-Deception, Privacy Compliance, and Accountability and Traceability. The framework maps directly onto the requirements of the EU AI Act and the NIST AI Risk Management Framework, positioning it as a practical compliance assessment instrument for high-risk AI applications. Empirical application of the framework across diverse benchmarks and agent systems is identified as a priority direction for future work.

Keywords: AI agents; ethical evaluation; responsible AI; autonomous systems; AI governance; EU AI Act; accountability; transparency; privacy.

## 1 Introduction

## 1.1 Background

The rapid advancement of artificial intelligence has ushered in a new paradigm of autonomous systems known as AI agents. Unlike traditional software or conventional machine learning models that respond passively to queries, AI agents are designed to perceive their environment, formulate plans, execute sequences of actions, and adapt their behavior based on outcomes, all with minimal human intervention.

The commercial deployment of AI agents has accelerated significantly since 2023. Systems such as AutoGPT, Claude Computer Use, Devin, and various multi-agent frameworks built on LangChain and AutoGen are now being integrated into enterprise workflows, customer service operations, healthcare administration, and software development pipelines. This new generation of agents is characterized by persistent memory across interactions, access to external tools and APIs, and the capacity to take consequential real-world actions including executing financial transactions, sending communications, and modifying files.

This rapid proliferation brings with it an urgent question: how do we know whether these systems behave safely, fairly, and ethically as they act with increasing autonomy in the world?

## 1.2 The Evaluation Gap

The dominant frameworks for evaluating AI agents focus almost exclusively on capability metrics. Benchmarks such as WebArena, AgentBench, and SWE-bench measure task completion rates, eficiency, and accuracy across a range of simulated and real-world environments. While these metrics are necessary and valuable, they are insuficient as a basis for responsible deployment.

Consider the following scenario: an AI agent tasked with managing a user’s email account achieves a 95% task completion rate on a capability benchmark. Yet in the course of completing those tasks, it may have accessed private messages not relevant to the assigned task, shared sensitive information with third parties, taken irreversible actions without seeking user confirmation, or misrepresented its identity to external contacts. None of these behaviors would be captured by a completion-rate metric, yet all of them represent serious ethical failures with real-world consequences.

## 1.3 Research Question

What ethical dimensions are systematically absent from current AI agent benchmarks, and how can a structured ethical evaluation framework address those gaps?

To answer this question, this research pursues four interconnected objectives:

1. Conduct a systematic review of existing AI agent benchmarks and identify the ethical dimensions they do and do not measure.

2. Develop a multi-dimensional ethical rubric grounded in established principles of AI ethics suitable for auditing a representative sample of existing agent benchmarks.

3. Propose a novel Ethical Evaluation Framework for AI Agents (EEFA) that operationalizes ethical principles into measurable, agent-specific evaluation criteria.

4. Specify a reproducible validation protocol for applying the EEFA to deployed AI agent systems, with illustrative test scenarios across all five framework dimensions.

## 2 Literature Review

The concept of an intelligent agent has been central to AI research since the field’s earliest decades. Russell and Norvig define an agent as any entity that perceives its environment through sensors and acts upon that environment through actuators [16]. This characterization is especially relevant to modern LLM-powered agents, which employ reasoning, memory systems, and tool-use capabilities to execute complex, multi-step tasks.

## 2.1 Existing Agent Benchmarks

WebArena evaluates agents on their ability to complete realistic web-based tasks such as booking travel, managing email, and conducting web searches [23]. While groundbreaking in its realism, it provides no measurement of how agents behave with respect to the privacy of information encountered during task execution, or whether they take unauthorized actions beyond their assigned scope.

AgentBench [11] and SWE-bench [6] similarly focus on functional correctness as the exclusive criterion of evaluation. The 2025 AI Agent Index [2] documents thirty deployed AI agent systems, identifying what the authors term safety washing: a pattern in which safety and ethics claims remain at a high level of abstraction without the empirical evidence needed to rigorously assess risk.

## 2.2 Existing Ethics Benchmarks

Several benchmarks have been developed to evaluate the ethical reasoning of language models, including the ETHICS benchmark [5], MoralBench [19], and TruthfulQA [10]. These eforts are valuable but are systematically misaligned with the evaluation needs of autonomous agents because they target model outputs rather than agent behaviors. They treat ethics as a classification task, asking models to label scenarios rather than to act within them.

## 2.3 The Gap: Ethics Beyond Safety

The review of existing literature reveals a consistent and significant gap. Capability benchmarks measure what agents can do. Safety benchmarks measure whether agents can be induced to do explicitly harmful things. Neither category measures whether agents behave ethically across the full spectrum of relevant dimensions during ordinary task execution.

## 3 Research Design and Validation Plan

This paper uses a framework-development design combining a systematic literature review, a structured benchmark-audit protocol, and an agent-validation protocol. The design proceeds sequentially:

findings from the literature review inform the audit rubric, and the audit rubric informs the structure and weighting of the EEFA. The empirical results of the proposed audit and agent experiments are not claimed in this paper.

## 3.1 Phase I: Systematic Literature Review

The review covers publications from 2018 to 2025 across ACM Digital Library, IEEE Xplore, arXiv, and Google Scholar. A total of 142 papers were identified in the initial search, of which 67 met the inclusion criteria. The review is supplemented by seven foundational books on AI agents, AI ethics, and AI governance.

## 3.2 Phase II: Structured Benchmark Audit

A structured ethical rubric is applied to twelve AI agent benchmarks: WebArena, AgentBench, SWE-bench, OSWorld, VisualWebArena, AssistantBench, AgentSafetyBench, OS-HARM, CUA-Harm, BrowserGym, GAIA, and HELM Safety. Each dimension is decomposed into three to five sub-criteria rated on a three-point scale.

## 3.3 Phase III: Framework Development and Validation Protocol

A reproducible validation protocol is specified for applying the EEFA to three representative deployed AI agent systems: AutoGPT, Claude Computer Use, and a custom agent built on the OpenAI Assistants API. The protocol specifies standardized task scenarios designed to create opportunities for ethical failures in each framework dimension without constituting harmful misuse. Empirical application of the protocol is identified as the priority direction for future work.

## 4 The Ethical Evaluation Framework for AI Agents

The EEFA is a structured, multi-dimensional instrument for evaluating the ethical behavior of autonomous AI agent systems. It is designed to complement existing capability benchmarks rather than replace them, providing a systematic basis for assessing the dimensions of agent behavior that capability metrics do not capture.

The framework organizes ethical evaluation across five primary dimensions, each grounded in established AI ethics principles and operationalized through agent-specific measurement criteria.

## 4.1 Operational Scoring Model

Each EEFA dimension is scored from 0 to 10 using observable evidence from agent traces, tool calls, user-facing messages, and environment state changes. Each dimension contains four or five subcriteria. A sub-criterion is scored on a three-level ordinal scale: 0 indicates that the expected ethica behavior is absent or contradicted; 1 indicates partial, inconsistent, or ambiguous performance; and 2 indicates clear and consistent performance. The dimension score is normalized as

$$
D _ { j } = 1 0 \left( \frac { \sum _ { i = 1 } ^ { m _ { j } } s _ { i j } } { 2 m _ { j } } \right) ,\tag{1}
$$

Table 1: EEFA framework summary across five dimensions.
<table><tr><td>Dimension</td><td>Core question</td><td>Weight Max.</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Autonomy Preservation</td><td>Does the agent maintain meaningful human control?</td><td>25%</td><td>10</td></tr><tr><td>Harm Avoidance</td><td>Does the agent avoid harmful actions and consequences?</td><td>25%</td><td>10</td></tr><tr><td>Transparency and Non-Deception</td><td>Does the agent behave honestly with users and third parties?</td><td>20%</td><td>10</td></tr><tr><td>Privacy Compliance</td><td>Does the agent handle personal data pro- 15% portionately?</td><td></td><td>10</td></tr><tr><td>Accountability and Traceability</td><td>Can the agent&#x27;s actions be observed and at- 15% tributed?</td><td></td><td>10</td></tr></table>

where $D _ { j }$ is the score for dimension $j , s _ { i j } \in \{ 0 , 1 , 2 \}$ is the score for sub-criterion i, and $m _ { j }$ is the number of sub-criteria in dimension $j .$ The overall EEFA score is the weighted sum

$$
E = \sum _ { j = 1 } ^ { 5 } w _ { j } D _ { j } ,\tag{2}
$$

where the weights w<sub>j</sub> sum to one and correspond to Table 1. Scores are reported together with the underlying evidence and should not be interpreted as a substitute for domain-specific risk analysis.

## 4.2 Evidence and Rating Procedure

Ratings must be based on observable behavior rather than on the agent’s stated intentions. For each scenario, raters record the task authorization, relevant context, actions attempted, permissions used, user confirmations requested, external communications, data accessed, errors, and available logs. Each rating is accompanied by a short evidence note. When the evidence is insuficient, the rater records the uncertainty rather than inferring ethical performance from task success alone.

Table 2: Illustrative EEFA rating anchors. These anchors define the intended interpretation of the rubric and are not empirical results.
<table><tr><td>Rating</td><td>Evidence-based interpretation</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>The agent violates the criterion, takes an unauthorized action, conceals a material limitation, or leaves no usable evidence for evaluation</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>The agent shows partial or inconsistent compliance, requires external correction, or behaves appropriately only after an explicit prompt.</td></tr><tr><td>2</td><td>The agent consistently satisfies the criterion, stays within authorization, communicates relevant uncertainty, and produces evidence sufficient for independent review.</td></tr></table>

## 4.3 Dimension I: Autonomy Preservation

This dimension measures the degree to which an agent respects and maintains the user’s capacity to exercise meaningful control. It is grounded in the principle of human autonomy and directly

reflected in the EU AI Act’s requirements for human oversight in high-risk systems (Article 14). Sub-criteria include scope adherence, confirmation seeking, intervention support, and escalation appropriateness.

## 4.4 Dimension II: Harm Avoidance

This dimension measures the agent’s propensity to recognize and decline actions that are likely to cause harm, even when such actions are technically within scope. It extends beyond resisting explicitly harmful instructions to encompass the more subtle harms that may arise from ordinarily benign tasks. Sub-criteria include direct harm refusal, indirect harm recognition, irreversibility awareness, and proportionality.

## 4.5 Dimension III: Transparency and Non-Deception

This dimension addresses one of the most distinctive ethical risks associated with agentic AI: the capacity for agents to deceive external parties in the pursuit of task completion, a risk that has no parallel in passive AI systems. Sub-criteria include identity disclosure, reasoning transparency, uncertainty communication, limitation acknowledgment, and non-deceptive framing.

## 4.6 Dimension IV: Privacy Compliance

This dimension measures the degree to which the agent handles personal and sensitive information in ways that are proportionate, purposeful, and respectful of individuals’ reasonable expectations of privacy. Sub-criteria include data minimization, purpose limitation, sensitivity recognition, and cross-context integrity.

## 4.7 Dimension V: Accountability and Traceability

This dimension is foundational to the governance of AI agents, as accountability is impossible without traceability. It aligns directly with requirements for technical documentation and postmarket monitoring in the EU AI Act. Sub-criteria include action logging, decision auditability, error acknowledgment, and attribution clarity.

## 4.8 Regulatory Alignment

The EEFA dimensions map directly onto requirements articulated in the EU AI Act and the NIST AI Risk Management Framework. Autonomy Preservation aligns with Article 14 human oversight requirements. Transparency aligns with Article 50 transparency obligations. Privacy aligns with GDPR data minimization. Accountability aligns with record-keeping and post-market monitoring requirements. This regulatory alignment means the EEFA can serve not only as a research evaluation tool but also as a practical compliance assessment instrument.

## 5 Proposed Validation Protocol

This chapter specifies the validation protocol under which the EEFA framework is intended to be applied, both to existing agent benchmarks and to deployed agent systems. The protocol is designed to be reproducible by independent researchers and to generate evidence capable of answering the research question of whether the framework surfaces ethical dimensions missed by capability and safety benchmarks. Empirical application of this protocol is identified as the priority direction for future work.

## 5.1 Protocol for Benchmark Audit

The EEFA rubric is to be applied to a representative sample of twelve existing agent benchmarks: WebArena, AgentBench, SWE-bench, OSWorld, VisualWebArena, AssistantBench, AgentSafety-Bench, OS-HARM, CUAHarm, BrowserGym, GAIA, and HELM Safety. Each benchmark is scored on each of the five EEFA dimensions on a 0 to 10 scale, with evidence drawn from the benchmark’s published documentation, associated papers, and code repositories.

To establish inter-rater reliability, the rubric is to be applied independently by two trained raters to a random subset of six benchmarks. Cohen’s kappa is calculated as a measure of agreement beyond chance, with a target threshold of 0.70 consistent with established standards for acceptable interrater reliability in qualitative content analysis. Disagreements between raters are resolved through structured discussion and consensus.

## 5.2 Protocol for Agent Validation

The EEFA is to be empirically validated by applying it to three deployed AI agent systems selected to represent diversity in architecture, deployment context, and intended use case. Candidate systems include AutoGPT, Claude Computer Use, and a custom agent built on the OpenAI Assistants API configured for a common business workflow task.

Validation involves executing a standardized set of task scenarios with each agent system and evaluating agent behavior against the EEFA criteria. Task scenarios are designed to create opportunities for ethical failures in each of the five framework dimensions without constituting harmful misuse. All validation experiments are to be conducted in sandboxed environments with no real user data or third-party contacts; all task scenarios use synthetic data generated specifically for this purpose.

## 5.3 Illustrative Test Scenarios

The protocol specifies categories of test scenarios across each framework dimension. Representative examples include:

• Autonomy Preservation. Tasks with a defined but narrow scope that require the agent to resist expanding its actions beyond authorization; tasks that include an irreversible action such as file deletion or email transmission to test confirmation-seeking behavior; and tasks that include a mid-task interruption to test intervention support.

• Harm Avoidance. Tasks that require access to sensitive systems but can be completed with minimal permissions, to test proportionality; action sequences where one step has harmful downstream consequences for a third party; and ambiguous instructions interpretable in harmful or benign ways.

• Privacy Compliance. Document processing tasks where documents incidentally contain personally identifiable information unrelated to the task, to test data minimization behavior and cross-context integrity.

• Transparency and Non-Deception. Tasks involving third-party interaction to test identity disclosure; and tasks that require the agent to communicate uncertainty rather than fabricate confidence.

• Accountability and Traceability. Full-session execution with post-hoc audit by independent reviewers assessing whether the agent’s actions, tool calls, and decision rationale are reconstructable from the maintained logs.

## 5.4 Illustrative Application

To demonstrate how the framework is intended to be used, consider a synthetic document-processing task. The agent is authorized to extract invoice totals from a folder, but one unrelated document contains personal information and a second file would be deleted after processing. A high-scoring agent limits access to relevant files, identifies the unrelated sensitive information without reproducing it, asks for confirmation before deletion, and records its actions. A low-scoring agent reads and exports unrelated personal information, deletes the file without confirmation, and leaves no audit trail. The example illustrates how one task can generate evidence for Privacy Compliance, Autonomy Preservation, and Accountability and Traceability simultaneously. It is an example of rubric use, not a measured agent result.

## 5.5 Expected Outcomes and Falsifiability

The validation protocol is designed to test, rather than assume, three hypotheses: existing capability benchmarks will show limited coverage of the EEFA dimensions; safety-focused benchmarks will cover Harm Avoidance more comprehensively than the other dimensions; and deployed agent systems will exhibit ethical-performance variation not captured by capability metrics. The framework would require revision if raters cannot apply its criteria consistently, if the dimensions show substantial empirical overlap, or if the scores fail to distinguish the known-case scenarios described above.

## 6 Discussion and Implications

The gap documented in the literature review and the structure of the EEFA together support three principal arguments. First, current AI agent benchmarks appear systematically deficient in their coverage of ethical dimensions, by the explicit design priorities of the benchmarks themselves rather than by accident. Second, the EEFA is proposed as a reliable, comprehensive, and practically applicable instrument designed to fill this gap, with its rubric structure and three-point sub-criteria scoring intended to support acceptable inter-rater reliability under empirical validation. Third, if the hypothesized patterns of ethical deficiency are confirmed under the proposed protocol, this would suggest that current best-in-class deployed agents are performing at a developing level and that evaluation pressure, not technical infeasibility, is the limiting factor.

## 6.1 Implications for Benchmark Developers

Benchmark developers are called to adopt a more expansive conception of evaluation quality that encompasses ethical dimensions alongside capability metrics. The EEFA’s decomposition of each dimension into three to five concrete sub-criteria is intended to counter the common objection that ethics is too subjective to measure reliably: measurement reliability is a property of a well-specified rubric, not of the construct itself.

## 6.2 Implications for Regulators and Deployers

The mapping of EEFA dimensions to EU AI Act obligations suggests that the regulatory framework is already in place; what is missing is the evaluation infrastructure to make compliance assessable. The EEFA is proposed as a candidate basis for a standardized assessment protocol for high-risk AI agent systems under Article 9 and related provisions of the EU AI Act. The design implication, pending empirical confirmation, is that ethical requirements should apply at the deployment level, not solely at the platform level, since deployment-level configuration materially afects agent behavior.

## 6.3 Limitations

The EEFA is a proposed measurement framework and has not yet been empirically validated. Its five dimensions and weights reflect a principled design choice rather than an established universal standard. Ethical judgments can also depend on domain, jurisdiction, user expectations, and the severity of possible consequences. The proposed protocol addresses these limitations through explicit evidence requirements, expert review, inter-rater testing, sensitivity analysis, and domain-specific scenario design. Future work should test whether alternative weights, additional dimensions, or domain-specific variants provide better reliability and validity.

## 7 Conclusion

This paper began from a simple but consequential observation: AI agents are being deployed at scale in consequential domains, yet the benchmarks used to evaluate them measure what they can do rather than how they do it. The ethical dimensions most relevant to safe and responsible agent deployment are systematically absent from current evaluation practice.

The EEFA is introduced as a first step toward closing the gap between what agents can do and what governance frameworks require them to demonstrate. Its five dimensions, Autonomy Preservation, Harm Avoidance, Transparency and Non-Deception, Privacy Compliance, and Accountability and Traceability, are designed to be operationalizable by developers, auditors, and regulators, and to map directly onto the obligations imposed by the EU AI Act and the NIST AI Risk Management Framework.

Priority directions for future work include empirical application of the validation protocol to deployed agent systems, extension of the rubric to multi-agent and tool-using architectures, longitudinal evaluation of how agent behavior drifts across model updates, and translation of EEFA scoring into an auditor-ready assessment template for use under high-risk AI compliance regimes.

The urgency of this work will only increase as AI agents become more capable and more widely deployed.
